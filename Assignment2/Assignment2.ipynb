        "**Note:**\n",
        "  - Regarding the decoding strategies, you are expected to work directly with model logits and sampling logic. Do not use `model.generate()` or any pre-built function. **Hint**: use \"outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids)\"\n",
        "  - For each function, you need to write clear and concise comments about your implementation. This may not be line-by-line, but rather meaningful chunk of codes.\n",
        "  - For each question, justify your answer with explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **We highly recommend using 'cpu' as the default for development, and switching to 'gpu' only for evaluating summarization performance. This is due to the limited GPU availability in the Colab environment.**\n"

            "(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court's decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.\n",

When I set parameter p and k to high enough value such as 90 percentile or top 30000 out of vocab size. The reason is that these sampling methods allow for a wider range of token choices at each step, leading to more varied summaries. \n",

The beam search method, even with n-gram blocking, still tends to generate similar outputs across different runs, which is similar to the output of greedy decoding. Even when I increased the beam size, the generated summaries were still similar accross different runs. When I printed out the cumulated probabilities, which is achieved by mutiplying the probabilities of each token in the beam, I figured out that the search for large beam size can not help the model to find another higher probability. The highest one always starts from the highest probable beam in the first step. This can be explained by multiplying many probabilities together overally mades the cumulated one become monotical decreasing. \n",

        "Based on the results stored in the table beam_sizes_results.csv, we can see that with large beam size (eg. beam size 3), the model can search for more probable candidates, which may leads to higher scores. Clearly, in sample 3, while beam size 1 and 2 returned rouge score 0.08, beam size 4 returned a larger score of 0.9. The boxplot showed that higher beamsize leads to higher mean ROUGE scores. However, the variance of the boxplot is also larger, which indicates that larger beam size may lead to more diverse outputs. This is because larger beam size allows the model to explore more candidate sequences, which can result in a wider range of generated summaries.\n",

        "From the boxplots of top-k methods, we can see that the larger the temperature, the more diversity of the output that model can generate, which may leads to lower ROUGE scores. With large temperature, the model predicts more rare words, hence the output significantly diverges compared to the reference summary. We can witness the means of the boxplots gradually decrease as the temperature increases. Some samples have rouge score 0 because the temperature is too high, which create the uniform distribution and the model can not predict any word that is in the reference summary. In addition, we can see that the variance of the boxplot with temperature 1 is larger than that of the boxplot with temperature 0.5, which indicates that larger temperature may lead to more diverse outputs. As if the temperature is smaller than 1, the distribution of tokens is sharper, which means the model is more likely to select the most probable tokens. This leads to less diversity in the generated summaries. On the other hand, if we set the temperature too high, the performance will be very poor. balancing the temperature is important to achieve a good trade-off between diversity and coherence.\n",
